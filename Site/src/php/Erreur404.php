    <h1>GIT GUD AT WWW</h1>
    <p>I sexually identify as a 404 Error page.</p>
    <p>Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of making users rage and getting salty because of me.</p>
    <p>People say to me that a person being a webpage is Impossible and I’m fucking retarded but I don’t care, I’m
        beautiful.</p>
    <p>I’m having a plastic surgeon install divs, navs, and even gifs on my body.</p>
    <p>From now on I want you guys to call me “Error 404, Page Not Found” and respect my right to rekt you from your
        browser.</p>
    <p>If you can’t accept me you’re a webophobe and need to check your WWW privilege.</p>
    <p>Thank you for being so understanding. </p>
